# Awesome-OCF

Publicly available projects or initiatives that work with OCF can be listed here. As OCF is still new, this list is very small. If you have or know of something to add, please open a PR to add it here!

## Contract Express Exporter

@JSv4 is working on OCF export functionality for Incorporation Documents managed in [Contract Express](https://www.thomsonreuters.ca/en/contract-express.html.html), a document and contract automation solution from Thomson Reuters.

## Formal Validation for OCF

@roehst is working on a [formal specification](https://github.com/Open-Cap-Table-Coalition/Open-Cap-Format-OCF/discussions/278#discussioncomment-3916016) of the OCF format, which will help verify the integrity of cap table exports and validate correctness of new OCF projects.

# Project Ideas

Here are a few project ideas if you want to contribute to the OCF ecosystem:

- Plugins for commonly used programs, such as an OCF editor in Google Drive.
- Programs that can find the differences between 2 OCF exports.
- Adding export and import functionality in your platforms.
- Converting OCF to common formats like PDF, CSV, XLSX, DOCX.
- Functionality to import events from OCF into a calendar.
