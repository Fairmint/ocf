# Transaction Tracing

Perhaps the important part of interacting with OCF will be traversing the event stack to determine the current state of a company's cap table. Most of the time, that will involve tracking the state of a given issuance of securities to a stakeholder from the date of issuance until the issuance is ultimately extinguished - meaning no shares remaining outstanding under the original `security_id`.

## Refresher on OCF ID Types and Uses

Remember, there are multiple IDs associated with issuance transactions, and each has a different purpose:

1. `id` - Remember, every OCF object has an id. This is meant to be a unique identifier within OCF such that no two objects _of the same type_ within a given OCF export have the same `id` value. (though the specific form is up to a given implementer). While implementers can assign id values that have significance elsewhere in their systems - e.g. using ids that correspond to some significant value in other cap tables or some sort of global registry of securities - we only use OCF `id` values to identify objects for programmatic processing and extraction of OCF cap table data.
2. `security_id` - This is best thought of as analgous to a certificate id in the old fashioned paper security world. Every issuance has a `security_id`, and this ID should be used anytime another transaction is acting on the shares issued in the issuance event identified with this `security_id`. **Here are a couple illustrations of where and how `security_id` is used**:
   1. To exercise an option, the `PlanSecurityExercise` transaction refers to a `security_id`. This must be the the `security_id` of the `PlanSecurityIssuance` event used to issue the option being exercised.
   2. To transfer shares of stock, the `StockTransfer` transaction's `security_id` field should contain the id of the `security_id` value provided in the `StockIssuance` event used to issue the original shares being transferred.
3. `custom_id` - is a freetext field provided to store a certificate ID (or some sort of other, implementer-specific id for a given issuance of securities).
4. `share_numbers_issued` - is meant to track specific share numbers that are part of an issuance in situations where shares are **not** fungible. For example, in a jurisdiction where issuing shares 300 - 500 is legall significant and different from issuing shares 700 - 900, you'd need to use this field to track the share numbers that are part of a given issuance.

## Terminal Transactions

A **terminal** transaction is one which none of the securities originally issued as part of an issuance event remain issued and oustanding to the same holder. In many cases, our OCF transaction events allow _part_ of an issuance to be extinguished - e.g. a transfer or repurchase in part - but some of the original issuance will remain outstanding, in which case this type of event is **not** a terminal transaction. For example, where 1,000 shares are issued to Bob and then Bob transfers 500 to Frank, leaving 500 of the original 1,000 issued to Bob. While this is not a "terminal transaction:, where an OCF transaction acts on an issuance only in part, you'll see an optional `balance_security_id` field on the operative transaction. If a `balance_security_id` field is present, it indicates a remainder from the original `security_id` (as illustrated in the preceding example with Bob and Frank) is still held by the original holder but now under a new `security_id`.

Keep in mind, however, that, even where the event acts on an issuance only in-part and some of the original issuance remains outstanding in the name of the original holder, the OCF spec requires that you us a new issuance event for this remainder of the original issuance. This remainder will have its own `security_id` for the "remainder" that remains outstanding in the name of the original holder. At this point, the original `security_id` from the original issuance is no longer in use.

## Transactions by Type

### Transactions referring to only a single `security_id`

Issuance and Acceptance transactions only refer to a single `security_id`. They do not have balance securities or resulting security ids.

### Transactions acting on issuances in whole or in part

1. **Cancellation Events** - transactions composed of [Cancellation](../schema_markdown/schema/primitives/objects/transactions/cancellation/Cancellation.md) - which includes `StockCancellation`, `WarrantCancellation`, `PlanSecurityCancellation` and `ConvertibleCancellation` - all extingush a given `security_id` and must refer to the pre-exsting `security_id` of the securities being cancelled. These transactions assume you can cancel an existing issuance in whole _or in-part_. Their `balance_security_id` field is meant to be used where an issuance is cancelled in-part and some of the original securities issued under the original `security_id` remain outstanding, issued to the same stakeholder as the original `security_id`.
2. **Conversion Events** - transactions composed of [Conversion](../schema_markdown/schema/primitives/objects/transactions/conversion/Conversion.md) - which includes `ConvertibleConversion` and `StockConversion` - are terminal. These events must link to the `security_id` of the original issuance being converted. If the `balance_security_id` field is present, it means the original security was only converted in-part and the remaining securities have the new `security_id` provided in the `balance_security_id` field. Any resulting securities from the conversion - e.g. Stock issued as part of a Convertible conversion or a conversion from preferred to common - should have their issuance ids in the `resulting_security_ids` field.
3. **Exercise Events** - transactions composed of [Exercise](../schema_markdown/schema/primitives/objects/transactions/exercise/Exercise.md) - which includes `PlanSecurityExercise` and `WarrantExercise` - are terminal. These events must link to the `security_id` of the original issuance being converted. If the `balance_security_id` field is present, it means the original security was only converted in-part and the remaining securities have the new `security_id` provided in the `balance_security_id` field. Any resulting securities from the conversion - e.g. Stock issued from a warrant or option exercise - should have their issuance ids in the `resulting_security_ids` field.
4. **Stock Repurchase** - [StockRepurchase](../schema_markdown/schema/objects/transactions/repurchase/StockRepurchase.md) transactions must link to the `security_id` of the original stock issuance that is being repurchased. Their `balance_security_id` field is meant to be used where an issuance is only repurchased in-part and some of the original securities issued under the original `security_id` remain outstanding, issued to the same stakeholder as the original `security_id`.
5. **Reissuance** - transactions should be used in situations analagous to where a certificate might be re-issued (such as with new legends). The [Stock Re-Issuance](../schema_markdown/schema/objects/transactions/reissuance/StockReissuance.md) transaction must link to the `security_id` of the original stock issuance that is being re-issued. There is no `balance_security_id` field as, in such cases, we require an issuance to be re-issued in full. There can be multiple issuances resulting from a single re-issuance, however, so each re-issuance can point to multiple `resulting_security_ids`.
6. **Transfer Events** - transactions composed of [Transfer](../schema_markdown/schema/primitives/objects/transactions/transfer/Transfer.md) - which includes `StockTransfer`, `WarrantTransfer`, `PlanSecurityTransfer` and `ConvertibleTransfer` - transactions must link to the `security_id` of the original issuance the transferred securities were issued as a part of. This transfer can be in whole or in part, and it can be to a single new issuance or to multiple new issuances. If the transfer is in-part, any remaining securities must be issued with a new `security_id` which should be referred to as the `balance_security_id`. The `security_id`s of the resulting issuances to the transferees should be recorded in an array in the `resulting_security_ids` field.

### Transactions acting on whole issuances only (terminal transactions)

1. **Release** - transactions composed of [Release](../schema_markdown/schema/primitives/objects/transactions/release/Release.md) - which includes `PlanSecurityRelease` - must like to the `security_id` of the original plan security issuance that is being released. There is never a `balance_security_id` field.
2. **Retraction Events** - transactions composed of [Retraction](../schema_markdown/schema/primitives/objects/transactions/retraction/Retraction.md) - which includes `StockRetraction`, `WarrantRetraction`, `PlanSecurityRetraction` and `ConvertibleRetraction` - must link to the `security_id` of the original security issuance that is being retracted. Unlike many of the preceding transaction types, there is never a `balance_security_id` on this transaction type.
